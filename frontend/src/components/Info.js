            <Typography component="p">
              Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
              enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID
              identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data
              model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID
              decides what it identifies.{" "}

              Why DIDs are being used in this project
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="p">
              DIDs allow users to attach multiple keys and abartary data
              seructures to an on chain entity they control. This unlocks the
              ability to identify and license AMMs and Bridges, this allows
              users of AMMs to have some certainty that the pool is created by a
              respectable authority and their funds will be safe. Bridge
              licenses can allow bridge programs that are stored on-chain to
              identify themselves.
