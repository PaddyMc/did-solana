### What it's all about

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

### Why DIDs are being used in this project

DID allow users to identify and licence AMMs and Bridges, this allows users of AMMs to have some certainity that the pool is created by a respesctable authority and their funds will be safe. 

### How this helps Solana

Regualation is coming to crypto, DIDs and services (such as the license-service used in this project) can allow AMMs and serivce providers to adhear to the coming regualtion by identifing and licencing different serivce providers in their eco-system.
